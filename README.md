# Smartwatch-Project-FreeRTOS
This is the FreeRTOS version. Another bare-metal version can be found in a different repository.

This is the code for my simple smartwatch project. The main focus was the firmware system. A list of features of this project is given below. 

Microprocessor: ARM Cortex-M4F  

Key accessories: an LCD, an external RTC, a pulse sensor (for measuring heart rate) and an inertia measurement unit.  

OS: bare-metal system & FreeRTOS (i.e. two versions of the same project)
